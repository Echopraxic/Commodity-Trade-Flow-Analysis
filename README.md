# Commodity-Trade-Flow-Analysis

As the world enters a progressively globalized era, it becomes increasingly important to consider 
the political and economic changes that accompany this. One way to examine this process is 
through analyzing the structure of international trade networks, which offers valuable insights 
into the political economy of the world. This project investigates the global commodity trade 
network using data from the United Nations Comtrade Database, specifically focusing on the 
year 2024. This data set captures the bilateral import and export flows between countries, 
showing a multi-dimensional and modern view of countries’ economic interdependence. We 
analyzed these relationships as a directed network, where countries are represented as nodes and 
trade flows as edges, weighted by trade volume and shaped by attributes such as GDP. 
Our primary goals are to identify central players in global trade, understand clustering 
tendencies, and simulate network dynamics through generative models. To achieve this, we pay 
particular attention to degree centrality, trade assortativity and the identification of regional trade 
blocs. We also apply the Watts-Strogatz small-world model to simulate trade structure, providing 
a benchmark for real-world connectivity characterized by local clustering and long-distance trade 
links. 

Theoretically, our project draws on world-system theory, specifically through a core-periphery 
lens, which posits that global trade is marked by asymmetries between highly interconnected 
“core” economies (e.g. U.S., China, Germany) and periphery economies with fewer high-volume 
trade partners. We support this by using GDP to size nodes. Furthermore, we bring in similar 
network analyses to support our results.  Notably, the USA and China are largely excluded from 
lack of self-reported data. 

Understanding networks of international trade through a geospatial-social network perspective is 
a significant methodological development in understanding the world through economic 
relationships. Luo et al. (2014) "A Geovisual Analytic Approach to Understanding Geo-Social 
Relationships in the International Trade Network" is key research. The authors accomplished 
spatial analysis and social network analysis by developing a geovisualization analytic 
tool(GeoSocialApp) that allowed users to explore geographical factors and social networking 
position. Their findings on the importance of geographical relationships and processes like 
"balkanization" are insightful to this analysis. However, their data was from 2005. The World 
Bank also offers an insightful source on trade flow visualization through nodes in buyer and 
seller perspectives; however, the precision and completeness of their visualizations lower its 
legibility. 

Significant historical events and the rapid growth of nations motivated a priority in this analysis 
towards a visualization of new global trade relationships, geographical contexts, and 
comprehensive analyses through both visualizations and calculations to provide a current and 
complete analysis of countries' relationships through trade.
